\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Magnetically Confined Fusion}
\subsubsection{Motivation for Studying Plasma Fusion}
The motivation for this master's thesis is to computationally narrow down the parameter space of a plasma that is confined in a magnetic field within a fusion reactor.
The complete physical laws governing the behavior of magnetically confined fusion are quite complex, and in totality are beyond the scope of a thesis proposal. 
As such, a bird's eye view of the current research being performed in the field of plasma physics will be presented. \cite{J_Friedberg:1}
This will be followed by a an overview of the diffusion model that will be explored in this paper.\\
