Plasma microturbulence is a leading candidate of the source

tokamak experiments. Global gyrokinetic
models have been shown to accurately predict the ion diffusivity, $\chi_i$

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Fusion as a Source of Energy}
One of the most pressing issues of the 21st century is providing affordable, sustainable, safe energy to the growing world population. As of 2014, there were still 1.1 billion people without access to any form of electricity, with an estimated 3 billion people without access to carbon free energy. Anthropogenically driven climate change has constrained this problem, making policy makers rethink long terms policies regarding coal and natural gas, while safety issues, and public perception, has led to a decreased investment in nuclear fission reactors in the US.\\
\\
Renewable, clean sources of energy, like large scale solar farms and wind turbine farms, are being adopted in many regions trying to adapt to the energy pressures presented by climate change. In Colorado, Xcel Energy has projected that the solar energy capacity will reach 342 MW by 2019, with 55 percent of all electricity being generated by a mixture of renewable energy sources by 2026. Germany's renewable energy capacity is capable of providing 95 percent of electrical demands at peak output, and expects that renewables will provide 18 percent of all power needs by 2020.\\
\\
It is tempting to extrapolate on this trend and expect that solar and wind power will eventually replace coal or nuclear fission power plants, however, due to the undependable nature of the sun and the wind, providing continuous electricity requires a base load power supply which has historically been supplied by nuclear fission and coal power plants. Due to the above-mentioned issues, it is desirable to replace the current baseloads with an energy source that is both safe and clean, and magnetic nuclear fusion has the potential to be this replacement energy source.\\
\\



\subsection{Magnetically Confined Fusion}
Magnetic nuclear fusion has been studied since the 1960s, but due to the fundamental complexity of controlling a plasma in a fusion reactor sue to issues like, progress in fusion research has stalled. These complexities include understanding the heat transport mechanisms that are unaacounted for by Coulombic interactions in classic transport models, which is the underlying purpose behind this proposal. Due to increasing computational power, as well as international  research collaborations, the 21st century has seen a resurgence in interest fusion energy as serious contender for sustainable energy, the most norable being the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER), which will resolve many of the issues that currently stand in the way of a working fusion reactor.\\
Nuclear fusion is appealing as an energy source due to the net positive energy release that occurs when two light elements collide with enough energy to cause the transfer of a nucleon from one nucleus to the other. In the deuterium-tritium reaction a proton from the deuterium atom is fused to the tritium atom, yielding a release of a neutron, and $\alpha$ particle, and the release of $17.6 MeV$ of binding energy. $14.1 MeV$ of this binding energy is given to the neutron, and it is this energy that a fusion reactor taps into to power a steam turbine. The nuclear equation for dueterium-tritium reaction is presented below, along with an illustration:
$$
D+T \rightarrow \alpha + n + 17.6 MeV
$$
 \cite{J_Friedberg:1} .\\

\\
Creating a sustained reaction of a 50-50 $\%$ Deuterium-Tritium mixture requires an input of $70KeV$, corresponding to a temperature on the order of $100*10^6$K. It is this high temperature environment that leads to the complete ionization of the deuterium-tritium mixture, resulting in a plasma.\\
More detail will be included below - just need to get ideas down.\\
%Is this enough detail on power balance? Should I go into more detail on what the sources and sinks are?
Due to the engineering requirements for magnetic pressure, plasma confinement time, and plasma temperature, with the complete explanation of these requirements being beyond the scope of this proposal, a toroidal geometry is the accepted geometry for a fusion reactor. The basic design requirements are as follows. The plasma is contained within the inner cylinder of a toroid, with the first wall of the cylinder being protected by a strong magnetic field that shields the wall from thermal loading from the $14.1 MeV$ neutrons, Bremsstrahlung heat loss, and heat conduction. Inside the first wall is the region called the blanket and shield, which is the region of heat exchange for powering an external steam turbine, and provides a tritium breeding ground that sustains the supply of tritium required for the fusion reaction. Outside of this region is the a shield wall which prevents the escape of any radioactive neutrons or gamma particles. The final layer of the toroid contains the superconducting toroidal solenoid, which generates the $10-15 [T]$ magnetic field inside of the fusion reactor, which again is responsible for confining the ionic and electron components of the plasma inside the reactor. Figures 1 shows the generic theoretical cross-sectional area of toroidal reactor, while figure 2 shows the cross-sectional area of the ARIES-AT tokamak design.\\

Not shown in the picture is the center, or donut hole, of the toroidal reactor. In current reactors, there is an additional magnet in this region that produces a poloidal magnetic field, which when combined with the toroidal magnetic fields produces the magnetic field lines, as seen in figure 3. Due to the Lorentz force, this configuration of magnetic field lines manages to capture the majority of the diffusing ions and electrons in a helical tractory around the magnetic fields lines due to to the Lorentz force on the charged particles.
\subsection{Diffusion, Neoclassical Theory, and Scaling Laws}
Maintaining a viable, power producing fusion reactor requires that power inputs and outputs be balanced within the reactor.
 This power balances requires an accounting of all of the power sinks and sources available to the plasma, as well as an accounting of all the transport mechanisms within the plasma. 
While we are using a 5-D gyrokinetic model in our simulation work, it can be illustrative to use the 0-D conservation of energy equation to demonstrate the basic principle of power balance. 
The 0-D fluid conservation of energy equation is given by:
$$
\frac{3}{2}\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \frac{3}{2}\nabla \cdot p \vec{v} + p\nabla \cdot v + \nabla\cdot \vec{q} = S
$$
where the internal energy $U$ has been substituted for $\frac{3}{2}p$\cite{J_Friedberg:1}.\\
Let's analyze this equation: The first term accounts for the variation of energy flowing into and out of the system with respect to time, the second term accounts for energy lost or gained due to convection of heat out of the system, the third term accounts for energy losses due to compression and expansion of the plasma within a reactor, the 4th term account for heat losses due to diffusion and conduction, and $S$ accounts for the sources and sinks available to the plasma. The sources are the $\alpha$ particle heating due to the D-T nuclear reaction and any auxiiliary heating being supplied to the plasma, while the sinks are the neutrons escaping the plasma into the blanket surrounding the reactor, and Bremsstrahlung radiation.\\
%%
\\
Assuming that the power production in the reactor has reached a steady state the time term drops out, as well as the convection and compression terms, leaving the 0-D energy conservation equation:
$$
\nabla\cdot \vec{q} = S.
$$
This equation makes intuitive sense. In equillibrium, if the diffusive processes are matched by the power sources sources and sinks, then a power balance will be achieved in the equation. If the diffusion of heat out of the system increases,  $\alpha$ particle heating has to increase to maintain power balance in the reactor, decreasing the efficiency of the reactor. \\ %Is this the correct interpretation of this equation?\\
%%
%%
Maintaining a plasma reactor with a viable power output requires that the transport of heat out of the plasma be balanced by the alpha heating power of the plasma. Characterizing the heat conduction parameter, or ion heat diffusivity $\chi_i$, in a plasma is current research, \cite{Yas_Ido} \cite{choong-seock_chang_et_al_partnership_2017} as it is the primary heat loss mechanism in a tokamak reactor. Per Friedberg “In a plasma there are three important types of transport: heat conduction, particle diffusion, and magnetic ﬁeld diffusion. Of these, heat conduction is the most serious loss mechanism... \cite{J_Friedberg:1}." \\

Classic and neoclassical diffusion model the ion heat diffusivity using a random walk model of the ions and electrons as they move through their gyrokinetic trajectory around the magnetic field lines in the toroidal reactor, interacting with other charged species along their trajectory, and imparting thermal energy. Neoclassical transport theory refers to the diffusion process within a toroidal geometry, which generates for a 2.4 fold increase in ion heat diffusion.\\
The classical and neoclassical models are unable to account for the observed, anomalously large transport of energy and particles across the confining magnetic field. It is assumed that that the anomolous ionic thermal diffusivity is a function of various local dimensionless quantities, including $\beta$ the ratio of plasma to magnetic  pressure, $\rho^*$, which is explained below.  Current research \cite{Yas_Ido} focuses on plasma microturbulence caused by steep ionic thermal gradients as the driving mechanism for this anomalous heat transport, and incorporates scaling arguments in $\rho^*$ to make predictions using available data from smaller scale fusion reactors to predict how ion heat diffusivity will scale to ITER levels. Scaling laws are laws used in fluid dynamics that are allowed to be made under dynamic and geomtric similarity situations, thus since the dynamics and geometries between tokamaks is nearly identical, scaling laws are useful when experimental validation is not available.\\

We define $\rho^*$ to be $\rho^* = \rho_i/a$ where $\rho_i$ is the gyrokinetic radius of the ion as it moves around the magnetic field in its trajectors through the fusion reactor, and $a$ is the minor radius of the tokamak, or the radius of the inner cross-sectional area of the tokamak. The reason that $\rho^*$ is interesting is because "Existing experimental devices can match all of these transport relevant dimensionless parameters expected in a reactor scale with the exception of $\rho^*$ \cite{McKee_Et}." The inability to set the parameter $rho^*$ in a lab experiment, and the advanced modeling and simulation capabilities of current tech, make a new study on ionic thermal diffusivity an ideal topic for a master's thesis\\

Thus, the stated purpose of this thesis is to determine how the ionic thermal diffusivity scales with a scan in $\rho^*$ up to ITER scales, to determine whether the diffusion becomes Bohm or gyro-Bohm like. Bohm diffusion indicates that the diffusin increases linearly with temperature, and is undesireable, while gyro-Bohm diffusion indicates that the  diffusion scales sublinearly with temperature, and is desireable.

%%This may be redundant with later material

We will use available experimental fusion reactor data, and implement surrogate modeling techniques to reduce the computational expense of running a simulation of 5-D high-fidelity gyrokinetic model. The outcome of this project will be a pdf of the ion diffusion, with uncertainties. Once this is accomplished, if time permits, we will perform a %push forward 
comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the heating model.
