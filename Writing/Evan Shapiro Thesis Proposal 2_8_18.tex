%The relationship between ion diffusivity, $\chi_i$, and the dimensionless radius $\rho*$ is given by
%$$
%\chi_i = (cT_e/|e|B )\rho*^{x_p}F(v_*, \beta, q_{\phi}, T_e/T_i, ...).
%$$
%
%The first coefficient is the Bohm diffusivity function, where $c$ is the speed of light in the plasma, $T_e$ is the electron temperature $e$ is the electron charge, and B is the perpendicular magnetic field. The second coefficient contains the dimensionless radius, where the exponent $x_p$ determines the scaling of the ion diffusivity with respect to the dimensionless radius. The third coefficient is the dimensionless group formed by all the relevant parameters.\\
%\subsection{Methods of Reduced Order Models to Characterize Ion Heat Diffusion}

%
% During this research project I will be focusing on the ion heat diffusivity, $\chi_i$, in a Tokamak reactor through the ion temperature gradient (ITG). I will be studying scaling properties of the ITG with respect to the dimensionless number $\rho* = \frac{\rho_i}{a}$, with $\rho* << 1$, and where $\rho_i$ is the ion gyro radius, or Larmor radius, and $a$ is the minor radius of a Tokamak reactor.\\


%Most research on the scaling of ion heat diffusivity is concerned with determining the exponential relationship between, $\chi_i$ and $\chi_B\rho*^{n}$. $\chi_B = $ Bohm diffusivity function if the one I am interested in studying the scaling behavior of the ion diffusivity with respect to $\rho$, as it has been established that the scaling can be Bohm like, or $\chi_i \propto \rho*^0$, or The scaling properties of the ion diffusivity in a n, as if the diffusion scales in a Bohm (linear) fashion with respect to $\rho_*$ then the chan

It has been established that the ion heat diffusivity scales with respect to variables such as the plasma temperature and the cross-sectional radius of the reactor core. If the scaling of the ion diffusivity is In a fusion reactor we are interested in the scaling properties of the ion diffusivity with respect to the dimensionless parameter $\rho* = \frac{\rho_i}{a}$, where $rho_i$ is the ionic gyroradius, and $a$ is the minor radius. If the scaling of the ion heat difussivity It is possible for a power discrepancy of this nature to occur if the thermal conduction, or ion diffusivity, scales linearly with the temperature of the It has been shown that thermal conduction of ions out of the plasma have the potential scale in a Bohm fashion with respect to the minor radius of a Tokamak reactor.

%\section{Motivation}
%
%The motivation for this project is tied in to the overall goals of the Partnership Center for High-Fidelity Boundary Plasma Simulation, which is working to understand the boundary physics of a magnetically confined plasma in a nuclear fusion reactor using high-fidelity simulations. \cite{PPPL_P:2}\\
%
%For clarity, the boundary region in a fusion reactor is defined as “extending 10\% of the outer-minor radius in from the magnetic separatix, through the open field line scrape off layer, out to the material walls.” The separatix is the point where the magnetic field lines cross, which in the case of the Tokamak is at the bottom of of the toroid, while the scrape off layer (SOL) is defined as the plasma region that is characterized by open field lines, and is outside of the separatrix. The SOL absorbs most of the plasma exhaust and transports it along field lines to the divertor plates. The divertor plates are responsible for absorbing heat and ashe produced by the plasma, minimizing contamination of the plasma, and protecting thermal and neutronic loads.\\

%The stability in the plasma boundary is critical to Tokamak operation, and thus the physics in the plasma boundary region must be understood before a fully functional fusion reactor can built. To elucidate the importance of understanding plasma boundary physics, an example of a critical issue related to stable operation of a fusion reactor is outlined below.\\
%
%Once a magnetically confined plasma reaches a heating threshold value the plasma transitions from a low-confinement mode (L-Mode) to a high-confinement mode (H-Mode). After L-H transition occurs, a steep pedestal in the plasma density develops in the plasma boundary region, as can be seen in figure 2.2. This transition brings a reduction in the radially directed electric field, as well as a reduction in the turbulence intensity, which in turn reduces heat transport, This reduction in turbulent transport leads to an increased heating in the ion core of the plasma by "a factor that is proportional to the temperature at the top of the pedestal." \cite{PPPL_P:2} The increased heating leads to a 2-3 fold increase in plasma power production, making the H-mode is the desired operating mode for future fusion reactors.\\
%
%Operating in H-mode requires a stable pedestal. However, the steep density gradient “acts as a source of free energy for the magnetohydrodynamic plasma edge localized modes (ELM),” \cite{PPPL_P:2} in which the pedestal repeatedly “crashes”, yielding bursts of plasma towards the divertor plates. A proposed solution to this problem is to use stochastic magnetic fields to stabilize steep gradient in the boundary region, and thus control the edge localized modes.\\
%
%The Partnership seeks to understand the L-H transition, pedestal structure, and the requirements for ELM stability and control. The plasma behavior in the boundary region is non-Maxwellian, and has non-equillibrium characteristics, requiring a first principles, 5-D gyrokinetic model, that simulates multiscale edge Tokamak plasma physics. Simulations include: The code used (XGC), which is a particle in cell (PIC) code, requiring extreme high performance computing (HPC) to run a full plasma simulation.
%
%One of the Modeling and simulating the magnetically confined plasma in the boundary region is incredibly imporant to progressing plasma research due to the difficulty of collecting data from inside a nuclear reactor.\cite{Smith_UQ:3} The complexity of the XGC code requires computational resources of the scale of Titan Cray XK at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. To reduce the computational complexity to utilize surrogate methods to reduce the complexity of the models in order to more efficiently analyze the scaling of the ion diffusivity of the plasma. Constructing a surrogate model allows us to captures the primary behavior of the modeled process, and is sufficiently efficient for model validation and uncertainty propagation. \cite{Smith_UQ:3}. To determine input parameters, boundary conditions and initial conditions, data from the C-Mod fusion reactor are analyzed in a probabilistic framework, in a process called model calibration.
