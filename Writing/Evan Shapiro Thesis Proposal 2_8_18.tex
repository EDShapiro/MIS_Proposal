\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Fusion as a Source of Energy}
One of the most pressing issues of the 21st century is providing affordable, sustainable, safe energy to the growing world population. As of 2014, there were still 1.1 billion people without access to any form of electricity, with an estimated 3 billion people without access to carbon free energy. Anthropogenically driven climate change has constrained this problem, making policy makers rethink long terms policies regarding coal and natural gas, while safety issues, and public perception, has led to a decreased investment in nuclear fission reactors in the US.\\
\\
Renewable, clean sources of energy, like large scale solar farms and wind turbine farms, are being adopted in many regions trying to adapt to the energy pressures presented by climate change. In Colorado, Xcel Energy has projected that the solar energy capacity will reach 342 MW by 2019, with 55 percent of all electricity being generated by a mixture of renewable energy sources by 2026. Germany's renewable energy capacity is capable of providing 95 percent of electrical demands at peak output, and expects that renewables will provide 18 percent of all power needs by 2020.\\
\\
It is tempting to extrapolate on this trend and expect that solar and wind power will eventually replace coal or nuclear fission power plants, however, due to the undependable nature of the sun and the wind, providing continuous electricity requires a base load power supply which has historically been supplied by nuclear fission and coal power plants. Due to the above-mentioned issues, it is desirable to replace the current baseloads with an energy source that is both safe and clean, and magnetic nuclear fusion has the potential to be this replacement energy source.\\
\\



\subsection{Magnetically Confined Fusion}
Magnetic nuclear fusion has been studied since the 1960s, but due to the fundamental complexity of controlling a plasma in a fusion reactor sue to issues like, progress in fusion research has stalled. These complexities include understanding the heat transport mechanisms that are unaacounted for by Coulombic interactions in classic transport models, which is the underlying purpose behind this proposal. Due to increasing computational power, as well as international  research collaborations, the 21st century has seen a resurgence in interest fusion energy as serious contender for sustainable energy, the most norable being the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER), which will resolve many of the issues that currently stand in the way of a working fusion reactor.\\
Nuclear fusion is appealing as an energy source due to the net positive energy release that occurs when two light elements collide with enough energy to cause the transfer of a nucleon from one nucleus to the other. In the deuterium-tritium reaction a proton from the deuterium atom is fused to the tritium atom, yielding a release of a neutron, and $\alpha$ particle, and the release of $17.6 MeV$ of binding energy. $14.1 MeV$ of this binding energy is given to the neutron, and it is this energy that a fusion reactor taps into to power a steam turbine. The nuclear equation for dueterium-tritium reaction is presented below, along with an illustration:
$$
D+T \rightarrow \alpha + n + 17.6 MeV
$$
 \cite{J_Friedberg:1} .\\

\end{figure}
\\
Creating a sustained reaction of a 50-50 $\%$ Deuterium-Tritium mixture requires an input of $70KeV$, corresponding to a temperature on the order of $100*10^6$K. It is this high temperature environment that leads to the complete ionization of the deuterium-tritium mixture, resulting in a plasma.\\
More detail will be included below - just need to get ideas down.\\
%Is this enough detail on power balance? Should I go into more detail on what the sources and sinks are?
Due to the engineering requirements for magnetic pressure, plasma confinement time, and plasma temperature, with the complete explanation of these requirements being beyond the scope of this proposal, a toroidal geometry is the accepted geometry for a fusion reactor. The basic design requirements are as follows. The plasma is contained within the inner cylinder of a toroid, with the first wall of the cylinder being protected by a strong magnetic field that shields the wall from thermal loading from the $14.1 MeV$ neutrons, Bremsstrahlung heat loss, and heat conduction. Inside the first wall is the region called the blanket and shield, which is the region of heat exchange for powering an external steam turbine, and provides a tritium breeding ground that sustains the supply of tritium required for the fusion reaction. Outside of this region is the a shield wall which prevents the escape of any radioactive neutrons or gamma particles. The final layer of the toroid contains the superconducting toroidal solenoid, which generates the $10-15 [T]$ magnetic field inside of the fusion reactor, which again is responsible for confining the ionic and electron components of the plasma inside the reactor. Figures 1 shows the generic theoretical cross-sectional area of toroidal reactor, while figure 2 shows the cross-sectional area of the ARIES-AT tokamak design.\\

Not shown in the picture is the center, or donut hole, of the toroidal reactor. In current reactors, there is an additional magnet in this region that produces a poloidal magnetic field, which when combined with the toroidal magnetic fields produces the magnetic field lines, as seen in figure 3. Due to the Lorentz force, this configuration of magnetic field lines manages to capture the majority of the diffusing ions and electrons in a helical tractory around the magnetic fields lines due to to the Lorentz force on the charged particles.
\subsection{Diffusion, Neoclassical Theory, and Scaling Laws}
Maintaining a viable, power producing fusion reactor requires that power inputs and outputs be balanced within the reactor.
 This power balances requires an accounting of all of the power sinks and sources available to the plasma, as well as an accounting of all the transport mechanisms within the plasma. 
While we are using a 5-D gyrokinetic model in our simulation work, it can be illustrative to use the 0-D conservation of energy equation to demonstrate the basic principle of power balance. 
The 0-D fluid conservation of energy equation is given by:
$$
\frac{3}{2}\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \frac{3}{2}\nabla \cdot p \vec{v} + p\nabla \cdot v + \nabla\cdot \vec{q} = S
$$
where the internal energy $U$ has been substituted for $\frac{3}{2}p$\cite{J_Friedberg:1}.\\
Let's analyze this equation: The first term accounts for the variation of energy flowing into and out of the system with respect to time, the second term accounts for energy lost or gained due to convection of heat out of the system, the third term accounts for energy losses due to compression and expansion of the plasma within a reactor, the 4th term account for heat losses due to diffusion and conduction, and $S$ accounts for the sources and sinks available to the plasma. The sources are the $\alpha$ particle heating due to the D-T nuclear reaction and any auxiiliary heating being supplied to the plasma, while the sinks are the neutrons escaping the plasma into the blanket surrounding the reactor, and Bremsstrahlung radiation.\\
%%
\\
Assuming that the power production in the reactor has reached a steady state the time term drops out, as well as the convection and compression terms, leaving the 0-D energy conservation equation:
$$
\nabla\cdot \vec{q} = S.
$$
This equation makes intuitive sense. In equillibrium, if the diffusive processes are matched by the power sources sources and sinks, then a power balance will be achieved in the equation. If the diffusion of heat out of the system increases,  $\alpha$ particle heating has to increase to maintain power balance in the reactor, decreasing the efficiency of the reactor. \\ %Is this the correct interpretation of this equation?\\
%%
%%
Maintaining a plasma reactor with a viable power output requires that the transport of heat out of the plasma be balanced by the alpha heating power of the plasma. Characterizing the heat conduction parameter, or ion heat diffusivity $\chi_i$, in a plasma is current research, \cite{Yas_Ido} \cite{choong-seock_chang_et_al_partnership_2017} as it is the primary heat loss mechanism in a tokamak reactor. Per Friedberg ‚ÄúIn a plasma there are three important types of transport: heat conduction, particle diffusion, and magnetic Ô¨Åeld diffusion. Of these, heat conduction is the most serious loss mechanism... \cite{J_Friedberg:1}." \\

Classic and neoclassical diffusion model the ion heat diffusivity using a random walk model of the ions and electrons as they move through their gyrokinetic trajectory around the magnetic field lines in the toroidal reactor, interacting with other charged species along their trajectory, and imparting thermal energy. Neoclassical transport theory refers to the diffusion process within a toroidal geometry, which generates for a 2.4 fold increase in ion heat diffusion.\\
The classical and neoclassical models are unable to account for the observed, anomalously large transport of energy and particles across the confining magnetic field. It is assumed that that the anomolous ionic thermal diffusivity is a function of various local dimensionless quantities, including $\beta$ the ratio of plasma to magnetic  pressure, $\rho^*$, which is explained below.  Current research \cite{Yas_Ido} focuses on plasma microturbulence caused by steep ionic thermal gradients as the driving mechanism for this anomalous heat transport, and incorporates scaling arguments in $\rho^*$ to make predictions using available data from smaller scale fusion reactors to predict how ion heat diffusivity will scale to ITER levels. Scaling laws are laws used in fluid dynamics that are allowed to be made under dynamic and geomtric similarity situations, thus since the dynamics and geometries between tokamaks is nearly identical, scaling laws are useful when experimental validation is not available.\\

We define $\rho^*$ to be $\rho^* = \rho_i/a$ where $\rho_i$ is the gyrokinetic radius of the ion as it moves around the magnetic field in its trajectors through the fusion reactor, and $a$ is the minor radius of the tokamak, or the radius of the inner cross-sectional area of the tokamak. The reason that $\rho^*$ is interesting is because "Existing experimental devices can match all of these transport relevant dimensionless parameters expected in a reactor scale with the exception of $\rho^*$ \cite{McKee_Et}." The inability to set the parameter $rho^*$ in a lab experiment, and the advanced modeling and simulation capabilities of current tech, make a new study on ionic thermal diffusivity an ideal topic for a master's thesis\\

Thus, the stated purpose of this thesis is to determine how the ionic thermal diffusivity scales with a scan in $\rho^*$ up to ITER scales, to determine whether the diffusion becomes Bohm or gyro-Bohm like. Bohm diffusion indicates that the diffusin increases linearly with temperature, and is undesireable, while gyro-Bohm diffusion indicates that the  diffusion scales sublinearly with temperature, and is desireable.
%%Add More Detail Above

We will use available fusion reactor data, and implement surrogate modeling techniques to reduce the computational expense of running a simulation of t5-D full-fidelity gyrokinetic model. The outcome of this project will be a pdf of the ion diffusion, with uncertainties. Once this is accomplished, if time permits, we will perform a push forward sensitivity analysis, by perturbing $\chi_i$ within the the full 5-D heating model.\\ 

\subsection{Gyrokinetic Equations}
\subsection{XGC Code \& Heating Models}
\section{Experimental Metholodogy}
Prediction under uncertainty is often an expensive and complicated process\cite{odensiam1,odensiam2}.
The tradeoff between the computational cost of complex models and the loss of predictive accuracy 
associated with simpler models may be addressed by emerging multifidelity UQ approaches\cite{ngmulti,Pehermulti}.

In magnetic confinement fusion, there is an important, clearly defined set of prediction scenarios, corresponding 
to modelling future reactor(ITER/DEMO) performance.  Even a ``high-fidelity'', extreme-scale model such as XGC, still
has a parameter space of large enough dimension to make a brute-force, 
sampling-based predictive process
impossible.  
%The $N^{-1/2}$ convergence, where $N$ is the number of samples of the quantity of interest(QOI), is infeasible given the requirements on computational resources. 
The traditional approach to prediction, with or without extrapolation, is to sample the model parameter input space
$\theta=\theta_1,\theta_2, \ldots, \theta_d$, evaluate the model, and return a quantity of interest (QoI) $Q(\theta)$.
Most realistic QoI maps are nonlinear in the QoI map(even if the governing PDE is linear), 
so the probability distribution function(PDF) of $Q(\theta)$ will
have to be estimate in a non-parametric way, typically
 by kernel density estimation, or by computing empirical 
statistics from samples.
The mean-integrated squared error
of the approximate PDF converges with a rate of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-2/(d+4)})$, where $N$ is the number of samples of the model
and $d$ is the dimension of the input space.  As each sample typically involves a PDE solve and subsequent post-processing,
this process quickly becomes exorbitantly expensive.  

\subsection{Surrogate Models}

A surrogate model replaces the large cost of the model solve 
with a fast, explicit function evaluation.  The surrogate model
is constructed via interpolation or regression on a modest number 
of potentially deterministic traning samples $M$.  The
error from insufficient samples in the kernel density estimation is exchanged for the error between the true QoI $Q(\theta)$ and surrogate QoI $Q_S(\theta)$\cite{butler2013propagation}.
Sparse grid approaches \cite{bungartz2004,Jakeman2011LocalAD} give roughly the same error(modulo a factor of $n^{d-1}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the (input) parameter space and $n$ is the number of
training points)) as traditional tensor-product surrogates.
However, the number of samples is  $\mathcal{O}(2^n n^{d-1})$, instead of the full grid cost of $\mathcal{O}(2^{nd})$.  
These savings and accuracy can potentailly be increased by adopting adaptive sparse grid surrogates\cite{bungartz2004}.

\subsubsection*{Augmented Surrogates}

In predictive extrapolation, the target scenario for $Q(\theta)$ is often sufficiently expensive to even make the surrogate 
approach tenuous.   One strategy in this
situation is to construct the surrogate using a sequence of lower-fidelity models to construct $\tilde{Q}(\theta)$, and then train the surrogate\cite{Pehermulti}.  This often requires
a good characterization of the error between $Q(\theta)$ and $\tilde{Q}(\theta)$.  This is not a well-explored or understood area in the kinetic plasma PIC community.  

Another approach is to add deterministic parameters that describes ``nearby'' scenarios,
s.t. $Q(\theta)=A(\theta,k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_r)$, $k_i$ fixed.  We call the determanistic parameters $k_i$ augmentation parameters, and the surrogate model
$A_S$ of $A$, the augmented surrogate.  Moderate gains are achieved when the number of augmentation parameters is small and the cost of sampling $A$ outside of the prediction
scenario $Q$ is much cheaper.  If the gradient of $A$ with respect to $\theta$ is only weakly dependent on the augmentation parameters, 
significant (cost-based) accuracy savings can be achieved.  

<<<<<<< HEAD
There are two fundmental assumptions in the construction of an augmented surrogate of
a $n$-dimensional predictive scenario $Q(\theta_1,\theta_2,\ldots,\theta_n)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item There exists small number $m$ of (usually deterministic) parameters $d_1,d_2,\ldots,d_m$ that characterize
nearby $n$-dimensional predictive scenarios $\tilde{Q}_i(\theta_1,\theta_2,\ldots,\theta_n)$.
\item The cost of a sample from the nearby scenario, $C_{\tilde{Q}_i}$, is much less than the cost $C_Q$ of 
a sample from the desired prediction scenario.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Motivation for Performing Study}
>>>>>>> 6f21f4ca132eabe95ad55dea398ef4f20d0aadf1

The {\em augmented surrogate} is a surrogate model $A(\theta,d)$ constructed on training data $\{(\theta,d),\hat{Q}(\theta,d)\}$ in the $m+n$-dimensional
parameter space.   %We briefly illustrate this approach via the following numerical cartoon.

\subsubsection*{Adaptive sparse grid method}  
The classical sparse grid method is dimension agnostic\cite{bungartz2004}. All interactions
of the same order are treated equally. Often, a small subset of variables
and interactions contributes significantly to the variability of the function $Q(\theta,d)$.  If the variability in the $\theta$-dimensions is
greater than the variability in the scenario parameters($\{d_i\}$) then the overall cost of constructing the 
larger dimensional surrogate is actually less, due to the cheaper computational cost of $\tilde{Q}_i$.

We modify the 
greedy algorithm for constructing $h$-adaptive generalized sparse grid (h-GSG) in \cite{Jakeman2011LocalAD}.
The hierarchical surpluses for the current sparse grid are modified with a cost weight $W_C(d_1,d_2,\ldots,d_m)$ that approximates the relative
cost of simulating the added sparse grid point, and a $m$-dimensional distance metric that penalizes sparse grid
samples that are too far away from the prediction scenario $Q(\theta)$.  This encourages parameter exploration in $\theta_i$-dimensions at
inexpensive simulation levels, while rewarding coarse grid points that reduce the local surrogate error near the prediction scenario $Q(\theta)$.  

\subsection{Proposed UQ Study}
We will conduct a base parameter scan in $(\rho_*)$, at the mean values of the uncertain inputs.  This will verify that wedge, Eulerian versus PIC, or other factors do not impact the conclusions reached in \cite{Yas_Ido}.  This scan will also provide the first training runs for
the augmented surrogate $A$.  

Data from a range of $\rho^{-1}_*$ simulations will be obtained in the interval (100,600) will be provided by Varis Carey and other members
of the BPS Scidac team  from simulations run at NERSC and Oak Ridge facilites.  A budget of 20,000 SU at NERSC has been allocated for providing the data for this scaling study(which is already partially complete at the time of this proposal)
 and for additional simulations to train the augmented surrogate to cover the input parameter space.
The main input parameters parameterize the location, slope, and shape of the core heat source and boundary sink.  Additional parameters covering
torque will be allowed if the computational budget allows further investigation.  If NERSC resources are expended, certain (small-scale)
simulations will be conducted on CU-Denver or RMCC resources(Summit) under the supervision of Varis Carey.

\subsubsection*{Postprocessing Software}
Postprocessing software (python and Matlab) are available to extract plasma QoI from  XGC 2D and 1D diagnostic output.  The BPS team will
arrange a NERSC account to avoid transfer of large binary files and allow simulation data to be repurposed for future studies.

The second coefficient contains the dimensionless radius, where the exponent $x_p$ determines the scaling of the ion diffusivity with respect to the dimensionless radius. The third coefficient is the dimensinless group formed by all of the relevant parameters.\\

%  During this research project I will be focusing on the ion heat diffusivity, $\chi_i$, in a Tokamak reactor through the ion temperature gradient (ITG). I will be studying  scaling properties of the ITG with respect to the dimensionless number  $\rho* = \frac{\rho_i}{a}$, with $\rho* << 1$, and where $\rho_i$ is the ion gyroradius, or Larmor radius, and $a$ is the minor radius of a Tokamak reactor.\\

%\section{Motivation}
%
%The motivation for this project is tied in to the overall goals of the Partnership Center for High-Fidelity Boundary Plasma Simulation, which is working to understand the boundary physics of a magnetically confined plasma in a nuclear fusion reactor using high-fidelity simulations. \cite{PPPL_P:2}\\
%
%For clarity, the boundary region in a fusion reactor is defined as ‚Äúextending 10\% of the outer-minor radius in from the magnetic separatix, through the open field line scrape off layer, out to the material walls.‚Äù The separatix is the point where the magnetic field lines cross, which in the case of the Tokamak is at the bottom of of the toroid, while the scrape off layer (SOL) is defined as the plasma region that is characterized by open field lines, and is outside of the separatrix. The SOL absorbs most of the plasma exhaust and transports it along field lines to the divertor plates. The divertor plates are responsible for absorbing heat and ashe produced by the plasma, minimizing contamination of the plasma, and protecting thermal and neutronic loads.\\
%
%CHECK CITATION ‚Äì INSERT MAIN MAGNETIC FIELD LINE FIGURE HERE\\
%
%The stability in the plasma boundary is critical to Tokamak operation, and thus the physics in the plasma boundary region must be understood before a fully functional fusion reactor can built. To elucidate the importance of understanding plasma boundary physics, an example of a critical issue related to stable operation of a fusion reactor is outlined below.\\
%
%Once a magnetically confined plasma reaches a heating threshold value the plasma transitions from a low-confinement mode (L-Mode) to a high-confinement mode (H-Mode). After L-H transition occurs, a steep pedestal in the plasma density develops in the plasma boundary region, as can be seen in figure 2.2. This transition brings a reduction in the radially directed electric field, as well as a reduction in the turbulence intensity, which in turn reduces heat transport, This reduction in turbulent transport leads to an increased heating in the ion core of the plasma by "a factor that is proportional to the temperature at the top of the pedestal." \cite{PPPL_P:2} The increased heating leads to a 2-3 fold increase in plasma power production, making the H-mode is the desired operating mode for future fusion reactors.\\
%
%Operating in H-mode requires a stable pedestal. However, the steep density gradient ‚Äúacts as a source of free energy for the magnetohydrodynamic plasma edge localized modes (ELM),‚Äù \cite{PPPL_P:2}  in which the pedestal repeatedly ‚Äúcrashes‚Äù, yielding bursts of plasma towards the divertor plates. A proposed solution to this problem is to use stochastic magnetic fields to stabilize steep gradient in the boundary region, and thus control the edge localized modes.\\
%
%The Partnership seeks to understand  the L-H transition, pedestal structure, and  the requirements for ELM stability and control.  The plasma behavior in the boundary region is non-Maxwellian, and has non-equillibrium characteristics, requiring a first principles, 5-D gyrokinetic model, that simulates multiscale edge Tokamak plasma physics. Simulations include: The code used  (XGC), which is a particle in cell (PIC) code, requiring extreme high performance computing (HPC) to run a full plasma simulation.
%
%One of the Modeling and simulating the magnetically confined plasma in the boundary region is incredibly imporant to progressing plasma research due to the difficulty of collecting data from inside a nuclear reactor.\cite{Smith_UQ:3} The complexity of the  XGC code requires computational resources of the scale of Titan Cray XK at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. To reduce the computational complexity  to utilize surrogate methods to reduce the complexity of the models in order to more efficiently analyze the scaling of the ion diffusivity of the plasma. Constructing a surrogate model allows us to captures the primary behavior of the modeled process, and is sufficiently efficient for model validation and uncertainty propagation.  \cite{Smith_UQ:3}. To determine input parameters, boundary conditions and initial conditions, data from the C-Mod fusion reactor are analyzed in a probabilistic framework, in a process called model calibration. 

 \cite{PPPL_P:2}
The boundary physics of a magnetically confined plasma within a reactor are tied to variety of parameters. The parameter of interest for this study is the ion diffusivity 
As such, a bird's eye view of the current research being performed in the field of plasma physics will be presented. \cite{J_Friedberg:1}
This will be followed by a an overview of the diffusion model that will be explored in this paper.\\
