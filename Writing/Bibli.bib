The stress-strain behavior comprised elastic, yield, strain softening and strain hardening regions that were qualitatively in agreement with previous simulations and experimental results. The chain lengths, number of chains, strain rate and temperature dependence of the stress-strain behavior was investigated. The energy contributions from the united atom potential were calculated as a function of strain to help elucidate the inherent deformation mechanisms within the elastic, yield, and strain hardening regions. The results of examining the partitioning of energy show that the elastic and yield regions were mainly dominated by interchain non-bonded interactions whereas strain hardening regions were mainly dominated by intra-chain dihedral motion of polyethylene. Additional results show how internal mechanisms associated with bond length, bond angle, dihedral distributions, change of free volume and chain entanglements evolve with increasing deformation. "

Computational efforts are reduced by parametrizing the current profile linearly in terms of a number of physical parameters. Results of detailed comparative calculations and a sensitivity study are described. Illustrative calculations to reconstruct the current profiles and plasma shapes in ohmically and auxiliarily heated Doublet III plasmas are given which show many interesting features of the current profiles.}

  abstract={A novel method for inferring the toroidal current distribution from measurements of magnetic field and flux is presented. The method uses a Bayesian approach that gives the full joint probability distribution over all possible current distributions consistent with the measurements and their uncertainties. The plasma current is modelled as a grid of toroidal current-carrying solid beams with rectangular cross sections and the tomographic inversion corresponds to extracting information, such as mean values, standard deviations and marginal distributions from the joint posterior distribution over beam currents, as well as functions of the currents: plasma boundary, internal flux surfaces, X-points, etc. The method's intended primary usage is as a foundation for a principled probabilistic integration of multiple diagnostics, an example of which will be demonstrated. However, with suitable informative prior distributions, the method can be used on its own, giving in addition to best estimates, 'error bars' on plasma boundary, internal flux surfaces, X-point, etc. A fast approximation, suitable for realtime reconstruction of boundary, flux surfaces and q -profiles, will also be presented.}

The turbulence is measured by examining the correlation properties of the local long wavelength (k ⊥ ρ i ≤ 1) density fluctuations, measured with beam emission spectroscopy. The radial correlation length of the turbulence L c,r is shown to scale with the local ion gyroradius, L c,r ≈ 5ρ i , while the decorrelation times scale with the local acoustic velocity as τ c ~a/c s . The turbulent diffusivity parameter, D~(L c ,r 2 /τ c ), scales in a roughly gyro-Bohm-like fashion, as predicted by the gyrokinetic equations governing turbulent transport. The experimental one fluid power balance heat diffusivity scaling and that from GLF23 modelling compare reasonably well.}

Hence, constraints can be placed on the scaling laws even though the calculation of energy loss may be quite intractable. These constraints are derived for several plasma models and shown to be characteristic of the model. Hence, in addition to reducing the number of parameters which have to be obtained empirically, these results could delineate which plasma models are appropriate for the calculation of losses. They show that the empirical scaling laws at present proposed for tokamaks are incompatible with many conventional plasma models.}

The JT-60U/JET identity experiments were aimed explicitly at matching edge pedestal parameters in plasmas of the same geometry. The similar size of the two devices allows plasma configurations and conditions to be established for which the match of the dimensionless parameters (ρ * , ν * , β and q 95 ) and of the equilibrium geometry is carried out in plasmas that are also almost identical in dimensional terms. The results of the power and density scans at fixed (and matched) I p − B T show that, in a common range of ρ * , the pedestal electron collisionality, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0741-3335/46/5A/021/ppcf170226in001.gif] {\nu_{\rme}^{\ast }} , and normalized pressure, β p,ped do not match in the two machines, against expectations. In particular, the range of β p,ped of JT-60U ELMy H-modes with Type I ELMs is accessible to JET plasmas only with a Type III ELM edge, and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0741-3335/46/5A/021/ppcf170226in001.gif] {\nu_{\rme}^{\ast }} in JT-60U is consistently higher by ≈2 than in JET, for the same ρ * . A comparison of n e and T e pedestal profiles indicates that ∇ T e is comparable in the two devices, while JET n e profiles are steeper than JT-60U. The global energy confinement enhancement factor ( H 98 y − 2) is higher in JET than in JT-60U, and part of this difference is attributed to the reduced pedestal pressure in JT-60U compared with JET. The two experiments are analysed in detail to try to identify 'hidden' physics that may be the cause of the failure to achieve the pedestal identity as predicted. Although a full explanation for the different behaviour of the edge pedestal in the two devices has not yet been found, the possible influence of aspect ratio effects on MHD stability, differences in the plasma current profile and ripple loss (and rotation) effects are discussed.}

Problems involving the spatial expansion of dynamic plasmas can result in statistical under representation of particle distributions in critical regions. Furthermore, when considering code optimization for massively parallel operation, it is useful to maintain a uniform number of particles per cell. Accordingly, we have developed an algorithm for coalescing or fissioning particles on 2D and 3D orthogonal grids that is based on a method of Assous et al. [F. Assous, T. Pougeard Dulimbert, J. Segre, J. Comput. Phys. 187 (2003) 550]. We present the algorithm and describe in detail its application to particle-in-cell simulations of gas ionization/streamer formation and dynamic, expanding plasmas. "

They are based on a statistical approach and are designed to conserve mass, momentum and energy. In addition, the correct spatial resolution of these values and the velocity distribution functions are reproduced. It is shown that charge and current densities before and after splitting and merging are in a good agreement. Furthermore, the reconstruction of the velocity distribution function is demonstrated. The new methods may lead to significantly reduced computational effort and memory consumptions which are exemplarily demonstrated by the 3D simulation of a streamer discharge formation. "

We show the performance of our algorithm in the case of the two-stream instability and the magnetic shower. "

abstract="A general method is presented for determining the mathematical expectation of the combinatorial complexity and other properties of the Voronoi diagram ofn independent and identically distributed points. The method is applied to derive exact asymptotic bounds on the expected number of vertices of the Voronoi diagram of points chosen from the uniform distribution on the interior of ad-dimensional ball; it is shown that in this case, the complexity of the diagram is ∵(n) for fixedd. An algorithm for constructing the Voronoid diagram is presented and analyzed. The algorithm is shown to require only ∵(n) time on average for random points from ad-ball assuming a real-RAM model of computation with a constant-time floor function. This algorithm is asymptotically faster than any previously known and optimal in the average-case sense.",

	Abstract = {Global electrostatic {ITG} turbulence physics, together with background dynamics, has been simulated in a realistic tokamak core geometry using XGC1, a full-function 5D gyrokinetic particle code. An adiabatic electron model has been used. Some verification exercises of XGC1 have been presented. The simulation volume extends from the magnetic axis to the pedestal top inside the magnetic separatrix. Central heating is applied, and a number, momentum and energy conserving linearized Monte Carlo Coulomb collision is used. In the turbulent region, the ion temperature gradient profile self-organizes globally around R / L T = ( R d log T /d r = major radius on the magnetic axis/temperature gradient length) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 6.5--7, which is somewhat above the conventional nonlinear criticality of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 6. The self-organized ion temperature gradient profile is approximately stiff against variation of heat source magnitude. Results indicate that the relaxation to a self-organized state proceeds in two phases, namely, a transient phase of excessively bursty transport followed by a 1/ f avalanching phase. The bursty types of behaviour are allowed by the quasi-periodic collapse of local E × B shearing barriers.},

  abstract={The ITER Physics Basis presents and evaluates the physics rules and methodologies for plasma performance projections, which provide the basis for the design of a tokamak burning plasma device whose goal is to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy for peaceful purposes. This Chapter summarizes the physics basis for burning plasma projections, which is developed in detail by the ITER Physics Expert Groups in subsequent chapters. To set context, the design guidelines and requirements established in the report of ITER Special Working Group 1 are presented, as are the specifics of the tokamak design developed in the Final Design Report of the ITER Engineering Design Activities, which exemplifies burning tokamak plasma experiments. The behaviour of a tokamak plasma is determined by the interaction of many diverse physics processes, all of which bear on projections for both a burning plasma experiment and an eventual tokamak reactor. Key processes summarized here are energy and particle confinement and the H-mode power threshold; MHD stability, including pressure and density limits, neoclassical islands, error fields, disruptions, sawteeth, and ELMs; power and particle exhaust, involving divertor power dispersal, helium exhaust, fuelling and density control, H-mode edge transition region, erosion of plasma facing components, tritium retention; energetic particle physics; auxiliary power physics; and the physics of plasma diagnostics. Summaries of projection methodologies, together with estimates of their attendant uncertainties, are presented in each of these areas. Since each physics element has its own scaling properties, an integrated experimental demonstration of the balance between the combined processes which obtains in a reactor plasma is inaccessible to contemporary experimental facilities: it requires a reactor scale device. It is argued, moreover, that a burning plasma experiment can be sufficiently flexible to permit operation in a steady state mode, with non-inductive plasma current drive, as well as in a pulsed mode where current is inductively driven. Overall, the ITER Physics Basis can support a range of candidate designs for a tokamak burning plasma facility. For each design, there will remain a significant uncertainty in the projected performance, but the projection methodologies outlined here do suffice to specify the major parameters of such a facility and form the basis for assuring that its phased operation will return sufficient information to design a prototype commercial fusion power reactor, thus fulfilling the goal of the ITER project.}
